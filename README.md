This is a website styled by Bootstraps, as part of the course "Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4", which is taught by [Dr. Jogesh K. Muppala](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~muppala/) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

In this course, I have learned to style the website with Bootstrap in the following areas:

* Bootstrap Grid
* Navbar
* Icon Fonts
* Buttons
* Forms
* Tables
* Cards
* Image
* Media
* Tabs
* Accordion
* Tooltips
* Modal
* Carousel

I have also learned CSS preprocessors - Less and Sass, as well as the preparation for deployment with NPM Scripts, Grunt or Gulp.

This is a very handful course, which I enjoyed a lot from learning.
